Interesting questions I've seen recently

* Given a sorted list of strings of an unknown language, identify the alphabet. Might not be possible if not enough sorted strings have been given.

* March-madness basketball - assume basketball tournament, 64 teams, every game is an elimination game. Users predict the outcomes of games at the beginning of the tournament. At the end of the tournament you've to score all the user's predictions - 1 point for 1 correct prediction. How do you store these predictions efficiently in terms of memory. Hint: there's a way to do it with just 1 bit per game.

* Find the kth smallest int in an unsorted array of ints.

* Given three strings A, B, C, determine whether C can be generated by interleaving characters from A and B. The strings can have common letters. Interleaving implies the letters from a string have to appear in string C in the same order.

* Algorithm to find median for a distributed dataset - doing a full distributed sort is too expensive.

* Given a list of positive unsorted ints, find the smallest missing number. If nothing is missing, then return n+1 where n is size of array.
