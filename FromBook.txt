2 32 bit numbers - N and M 
2 bit positions i and j


Insert M into N such that M starts at j and ends at i. 

assume j through i should have space for M

Example:

N = 10000000000
M = 10011
i = 2
j = 6

N = 100010001100



Given a real number between 0 and 1 (eg 0.72) that is passed as a double, print the binary representation. 
If the number cannot be represented acurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print ERROR.
