Implement an algo to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list:

// This will not work will the last node needs to be deleted
void Delete (Node n)
{
    Node previous = null;

    while (n.Next != null)
    {
        Swap(n, n.Next); 
        previous = n;
        n = n.Next;         
    } 

    previous.Next = null; 
}
